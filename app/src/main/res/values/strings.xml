    <string name="Title">Design of a Breed Classifier for a Smart Rabbitry using Deep Learning</string>
    <string name="Description">A mobile application that can classify the breeding of the rabbit and give a percentage of what breed the rabbit is using a deep learning model.</string>
    <string name="Objective">Specific Objectives:</string>
    <string name="Objective1">- To design an application that will accurately detect the correct breed of a rabbit.</string>
    <string name="Objective2">- To design an application that will notify the user about a rabbits breeding status.</string>
    <string name="Objective3">- To design an application that stores information about each rabbit that can be accessed by scanning the QR code and would provide important analytics to the user.</string>
    <string name="Objective4">- To test and evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the application.</string>

    <string name="Problem">Problem of the  Current Situation</string>
    <string name="ProblemBody1">The client experiences difficulty in identifying the breed  of individual rabbits in the rabbitry. This includes  difficulties in storing information about individual rabbits</string>
    <string name="ProblemBody2">The client experiences difficulty in identifying family  members of a rabbit due to the manual recording system  he is currently using with his notebook.</string>

    <string name="InfoBody">An application that can classify a rabbits breed to help new and old rabbit breeders to decide which breed is suitable for their farm. In this project, rabbitâ€™s features such as color, size, shape and weight can be a factor in determining the breed of the rabbit. The features will serve as an input which will be processed by the deep learning model. The output will be a percentage of what breeds the rabbit. The deep learning model will be trained using the validated datasets that the team gathered.</string>
    <string name="Currentsit">Current Situation</string>
    <string name="Records">Records of rabbit information are  manually written in a notebook</string>
    <string name="Records1">The	notebook	contains	the	following	information  about the rabbit: Is the rabbit ready for breeding?  Is the rabbit ready to be sold? Is the rabbit good for consumption?  Is the rabbit good to be sold as a pet?</string>

    <string name="ProposedTitle">Proposed Solution</string>
    <string name="Proposed1">MOBILE APP FUNCTIONS</string>
    <string name="Proposed2">- Detects the breed of each rabbit.</string>
    <string name="Proposed3">- Notify the user if the rabbit can breed after 4-6 months  since being born.</string>
    <string name="Proposed4">- Notify the user after breeding. A rabbit can breed again  around 29-30 days from the last breeding.</string>
    <string name="Proposed5">- Assign a QR code to each rabbit to store information.</string>
